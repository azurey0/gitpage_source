Welcome to my site! I'm Ran Zhang, currently a MSBA student at UC Davis. I am data-driven, and always seeking for meaning beyond data. I lived in Guangzhou, Sydney, Beijing, and now I am in Bay Area.  

I interned at several tech companies in China during 2018 - 2021. 
    
As a **Data Analyst**: 
- At Kuaishou, who develops the second-largest short video platform globally, I analyzed 2 billion users' behavior data changes and completed a social network analysis project. 
- At Baidu, who owns the first and largest Chinese search engine, I proposed optimization suggestions for its recommendation methods.  

Before that, I experienced different roles in tech. I had six months' experience with Tencent as a user researcher, where I tracked 'Pan-Entertainment' changes and collaborated with game development teams. I familiarized IT project management and consulting Accenture and Qunar, a leading OTA company in China.  

Besides work, I keep on doing interesting data mining projects, including **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Analysis, Data Visualization**. See Portfolio and Posts for more!  

I love games and sci-fi (A good sci-fi is like a revelation for tech and future, isn't it?). I'm reading *NeuroLogic* by Eliezer Sternberg. 

I'm looking for jobs and here's [my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E36B0MVtbk9dC99hzBIhJZHw6rpPCQnE/view?usp=sharing)!
